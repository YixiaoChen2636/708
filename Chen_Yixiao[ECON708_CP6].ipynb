    "A prospective employer receives two resumes: a resume from a white job applicant and a similar resume from an African American applicant. Is the employer more likely to call back the white applicant to arrange an interview? Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan carried out a randomized controlled experiment to answer this question. Because race is not typically inclued on a resume, they differentiated resumes on the basis of \"White-sounding\" names and \"African American-sounding\" names. A large collection of fictitious resumes was created, and the presupposed \"race\" was randomly assigned to each resume. These resumes were sent ot prospective employers to see which resumes generated a phone call (a call back) from the prospecive employer. Data from the experiment and a detailed data description are attached to the assignment description\n",

    "A. Define the callback rate as the fraction of resumes that generate a phone call from the prospective employer. What was the callback rate for whites? For African Americans? Is the difference statistically significant? Is the difference large?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Is the African American callback rate differential different based upon gender?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. What is the difference in callback rates for high-quality vs. low-quality resumes? What is the high/low quality difference for white applicants? What is the high/low quality difference for African American applicants? Is there a statistically significant difference between these differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "D. The authors of the study claim that race was assigned randomly to the resumes. Is there any evidence of non-random assignment?"

    "Does viewing a violent movie lead to violent behavior? If so, the incidence of violent crimes, such as assaults, should rise following the release of a violent movie that attracts many viewers. Alternatively, movie viewing may substitute for other activities (such as alcohol consumption) that lead to violent behavior. so that assaults should fall when more viewers are attracted to the cinema. On the assignment description you will find thefile `Movies`, which contains data on the number of assaults and movie attendance for 516 weekends from 1995 through 2004. A detailed description is given in `Movies_Description`, also available on the assignment description. The data set includes weekend U.S. attendance for strongly violent movies (such as *Hannibal*), mildly violent movies (such as *Spider-Man*) ,and nonviolent movies (such as *Finding Nemo*). The data set\n",
